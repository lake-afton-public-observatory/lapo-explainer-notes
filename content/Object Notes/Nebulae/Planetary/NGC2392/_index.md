### In the telescope

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm

2.	As you look through the telescope you will see two stars that are about the same brightness.  One of them will appear fuzzy.  The fuzzy one is the planetary nebula.
   
3.	You can ask people to compare the appearance of the nebula and the star.

### NGC2392 "Eskimo Nebula" Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	This nebula was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel, the same astronomer who discovered Uranus.

2.	The gas in the nebula is expanding outward with a velocity of about 68 miles per second.

| **Item**    | **Updated** | **Notes** |
| Coordinates | 2003-01-08  | updated with SIMBAD |
| Distance    | 2003-01-08  | previously 3000 ly – BUT says 5000 at <http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2000/07/text> and <http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020407.html> |
|Diameter|2003-01-08|previously 0.6 ly / 36,000 AU’s – BUT this comes from distance of 3,000 ly... all distance info I’ve found says 5000 ly; with ang diam 0.7 arcmin, this corresponds to 1.01 ly <http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/n2392.htm>|
|Actual Brightness – Star|2003-01-08|close enough to <http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/n2392.htm>|
|Magnitude – Star|2003-01-08|close enough to <http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/n2392.htm>|
|Spectral Type – Star|2003-01-08|previously O8 dwarf – but SIMBAD says O6|
|Surface Temperature – Star|2003-01-08|previously said 40,000 K – changed to F – BUT cannot find support, but looks OK|
|Age|2003-01-08|previously 1,700 years – but says gas composed outer layers of star 10,000 years ago <http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020407.html>|
|Density|--|  |
|Other Information|2003-01-08|previously said “The nebula’s age of about 1,700 years makes it one of the youngest planetary nebulae known.”  – BUT nebula is 10,000 years old, may not be one of youngest  <https://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resource_page/129/stars_stellar_evolution/topic#resource_tab> Found no support for 68 miles per second speed, but sounds OK  <http://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/n2392.html>|
|Distance|2010-11-16|this is widely varying, depending on the source but most seem to agree on something close to 3,000 ly.|
|Diameter|2010-11-16|based on the updated distance information, the diameter is 36,000 AU or about 0.6 ly|
