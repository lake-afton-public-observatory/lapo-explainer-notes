### General Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Huge clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.

2.	Over the course of a few hundred thousand or a few million years the cloud will break up into 100 200 smaller clouds and each of these smaller clouds will become a star. 

3.	These clouds contain very little matter compared to the amount of space they take up.  In fact they are a better vacuum than any vacuum we can make on Earth.

4.	If you take a piece of this nebula that is the size of the Earth, all the material in that piece will fill a thimble.

5.	If you blow up a balloon one foot across, it contains as much air (matter) as these clouds contain in a box that is 500 thousand miles on each side.

6.	The sun formed out of a cloud similar to this one about 5 billion years ago.

7.	Diffuse Nebulae are emission nebulae.

    a.	Young, hot stars in the nebula heat up the gas in the nebula.

    b.	The heated gas emits light.
