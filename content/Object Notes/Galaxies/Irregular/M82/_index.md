### In the telescope

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 80mm
   
2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a cigar-shaped fuzzy patch of light.
   
3.	If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field, then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
4.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs they may have seen.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of many hours.  This long exposure brings out the spiral arms and other details.  Our eyes allow the light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.  


### M82 Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	This galaxy is also called the “Cigar Galaxy” because it’s shaped like a cigar.
 
2.	Johann Bode discovered this galaxy and its neighbor, M81, on December 31, 1774.  Pierre Méchain independently rediscovered the two galaxies in 1779, and reported them to his friend Charles Messier.  Messier included them in his famous catalog after he measured their positions on February 9, 1781.  (M81 is a spiral galaxy.)

3.	Recently in this galaxy’s history – a few tens of millions of years ago – a close encounter occurred between M81 and M82.  As a result, M82 is a “starburst galaxy.”  Due to the close encounter, shock waves were sent through M82, triggering an intense period of star formation.

4.	Along with new stars forming, lots of gas is flowing and being pushed around, making this galaxy a strong source of radio emission.

|Galactic Type|2003-01-15|previous: Pec – BUT SEDs says Ir-II|
|Other Information|2003-01-15|info from SEDs site<br/>previous: “Evidence suggests that a violent explosion occured in the central regions of the galaxy about 1.5 million years ago.  This explosion would have involved several million stars.” – I think this means the starburst activity now described|
