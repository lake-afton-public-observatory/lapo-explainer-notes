### General Information

1.	Most galaxies fit one of the three types: 
<br/>

    |**Type**|**Description**| 
    |---|---|
    |**Spiral**|The most common type of galaxy is called a "spiral galaxy." Not surprisingly, spiral galaxies look like spirals, with long arms winding toward a bright bulge at the center.<br/>Spiral galaxies are denoted Sa, Sb or Sc|
    |**Elliptical**|Elliptical galaxies are also named because of their shapes. Elliptical galaxies range from circular (remember, a circle is an ellipse!) to long, narrow, and cigar-shaped.<br/>Elliptical galaxies are denoted E0-E7, near spherical to highly elongated, respectively.|
    |**Lenticular**| have a central bulge, but no spiral arms. If the central bulge is not very bright, it can be very difficult to tell the difference between a lenticular galaxy and an E0 galaxy.<br/><br/>Just like spiral galaxies, some lenticular galaxies have a bar. They are called "barred lenticular galaxies" and are denoted SB0. Normal lenticular galaxies are denoted S0.|
    |**Irregular**|... but about 3% of the galaxies we observe are very different!|

<br/> 

2.  These so-called "irregular galaxies" do not have a lot of common features. Many of them are the results of galaxy collisions or near misses. 

2.  One type of irregular galaxy is called a "starburst galaxy." Starburst galaxies shine brightly as many new stars are born in a short period of time.

3.  Irregular galaxies are usually found in groups or clusters, where collisions and near-misses between galaxies are common. In a few irregular galaxies, astronomers can't figure out why they look so strange!
