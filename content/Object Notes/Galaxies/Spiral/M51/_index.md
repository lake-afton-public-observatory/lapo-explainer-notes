### In the telescope

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a fuzzy patch of light.  This is the galaxy.  If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field and then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
3.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs of galaxies.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of many hours.  This long exposure brings out spiral arms and other details.  Our eyes allow the light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.
   
4.	This galaxy is “face-on.”  As a result visitors may be able to see some spiral structure.  The companion to the main galaxy can also be seen.

### M51 Information

1.	A companion galaxy happens to be passing near the large spiral at this point in time.  As a result of the passage, one of the arms is mis-shaped.  This cannot be seen in the telescope but can be easily seen in the photograph.

2.	This galaxy is also called the Whirlpool galaxy.
 
3.	Charles Messier discovered this galaxy in 1773.  His friend discovered the companion galaxy in 1781.

4.	This galaxy was the first to be recognized as having spiral structure, thanks to a very accurate and careful painting made by Lord Rosse in 1845.
