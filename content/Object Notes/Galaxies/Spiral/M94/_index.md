### In the telescope

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a fuzzy patch of light.  This is the galaxy.  If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field, then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
3.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs of galaxies they may have seen.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of may hours.  This long exposure brings out the spiral arms and other details.  Our eyes allow the light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.
   
4.	This particular galaxy is bright, compact, and nearly circular.
