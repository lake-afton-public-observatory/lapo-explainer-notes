### In the telescope

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a fuzzy patch of light.  This is the galaxy.  If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field, then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
3.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs of galaxies they may have seen.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of many hours.  This long exposure brings out the spiral arms and other details.  Our eyes allow the light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.

### M66 Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	This galaxy was discovered in 1780 by Pierre Méchain.  However, Charles Messier  didn’t acknowledge his friend’s prior discovery, unlike for most of Méchain’s findings.  Messier catalogued it on March 1, 1780.

2.	Three galaxies – M65, M66, and NGC 3628 – are all about 35 million light years away.  Together, they are called the Leo Triplett.

3.	M66 is larger than its neighbor, M65.

4.	Three supernovae have occurred in this galaxy: 1973R was discovered December 12, 1973; 1989B was discovered Jan 31, 1989; and 1997bs was discovered April 15, 1997.

|**Item**|**Updated**|**Notes**|
|Coordinates|2003-01-15|SEDs gives 11 20.2 +12 59<br/>SIMBAD gives 11 20 15 +12 59 22|
|Distance|2003-01-15|previously said 29-38 million ly<br/>– BUT this OK with<br/> <http://messier.seds.org/m/m066.html>|
|Actual Brightness|2003-01-15|can find no support|
|Diameter|2003-01-15|added “~”: SEDs page says M66 is “considerably larger” than M65,<br/>yet can’t find diameter for M65.  This looks good for now.|
|Mass|--|  |
|Galactic Type|2003-01-15|OK with SEDs site|
|Other Information|2003-01-15|previously: “M65 and M66 are about 180,000 light years away from each other.” – BUT, found do direct support, so summarized and added PLEASE NOTE at several places they really DO spell it “Triplett,” instead of “Triplet.”|
