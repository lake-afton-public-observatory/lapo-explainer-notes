* Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system.  Its 3,200 mile diameter makes it just larger than Mercury (3,029 miles), slightly smaller than Jupiter’s moon Ganymede (3,270 miles) and 40% the size of the Earth.  If Titan orbited the Sun instead of Saturn, it would be called a planet.

* Titan is unique because it is one of only two moons with an atmosphere.  The atmosphere is  95% nitrogen and 5% methane with methane playing the same role on Titan as water does on Earth.  That means there may be clouds of methane, lakes of methane, and ice caps of methane on Titan.  Triton (Neptune’s largest moon) is the other moon with an atmosphere.

* The Huygens probe, which descended to Titan in Jan 2005 found Titan had rivers and lakes of liquid methane-ethane.
