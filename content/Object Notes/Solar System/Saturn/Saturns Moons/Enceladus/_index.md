* Enceladus was the big surprise of the Cassini mission.  This moon is only 310 miles across and is too small to be seen with our telescope.  Its small size means it should be inactive and covered with craters.  Instead it has a large number of tectonic folds and faults and an active ice volcano was detected at itâ€™s southern pole.  Scientists believe Enceladus is so active because of gravitational tidal forces imparted on it by Saturn.
