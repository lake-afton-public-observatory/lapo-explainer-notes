1.	The rings are obvious through the telescope.

2.	Not as obvious but often visible is Cassini’s division, a dark line within the rings.  This division is named after the Italian-born astronomer Jean Dominique Cassini who first saw the gap in 1675.

3.	Saturn has 7 rings, but from Earth only three different rings can be clearly seen.  However, Voyager found that each ring is actually made up of hundreds of ringlets.  The ringlets can be compared to the grooves on a phonograph album.
   
4.	The particles in the ringlets are pieces of ice that range in size from a grain of sand up to the size of a car or house.  Each of these particles orbits Saturn like a tiny moon.
   
5.	Although the rings are 39,000 miles (63,500 km) wide they are about 100 yards thick.  The diameter of the rings is over 125,000 miles.  Imagine that you could shrink the rings so their thickness was the same as a DVD. The DVD would be about 1½ miles across.
