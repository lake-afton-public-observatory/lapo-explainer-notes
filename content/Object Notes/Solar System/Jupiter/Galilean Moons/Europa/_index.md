1.	Europa is the smoothest object in the solar system.  It doesn’t have any mountains and only a few craters that are less than three hundred feet deep.

2.	Europa is internally heated the same way as Io, but much less than Io.

3.	Europa’s surface is really a crust of ice.  Underneath this ice crust, there may be a liquid water ocean many miles deep.

4.	Europa is covered by a network of streaks and cracks.  If Europa is also squeezed a pulled a bit, these streaks and cracks may be where the ice fractured, filled with water, then froze.
