Nearest Moon to Jupiter

1.	The gravity of Jupiter, Europa, and Ganymede create powerful tidal forces, squeezing and pulling on the moon.

2.	One result is that the surface of Io bulges up and down by as much as 330 feet!  (Tidal forces on Earth’s oceans only make a difference of 60 feet.)

3.	Another result is that Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system: the squeezing and pulling heat up Io and power the volcanoes.

4.	The Galileo spacecraft observed 300 volcanoes that had been active at various times…

5.	These volcanoes spew out sulfur and sulfur dioxide at a rate of 10 thousand tons a second, enough to cover Io with 3 feet of material every 100 years.  Any craters that were on Io have long since been filled in.

6.	The sulfur compounds spewed out by the volcanoes produce a variety of reds, oranges, browns, and whites.  As a result, the surface of Io is very colorful.  One astronomer was heard to remark when he saw the first pictures of Io that he had seen better looking pizzas.

7.	Only three objects in the solar system are known to have active volcanoes: Io, Earth, and Neptune’s moon, Triton.
