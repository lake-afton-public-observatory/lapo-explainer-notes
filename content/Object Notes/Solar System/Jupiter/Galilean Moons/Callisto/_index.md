1.	Callisto is the third largest moon in our solar system and is about the same size as the planet Mercury.

2.	If Callisto went around the Sun instead of Jupiter, it would be called a planet.

2.	Like Ganymede, Callisto is half ice and half rock.

4.	Callisto is the most heavily cratered satellite in the solar system.  There are no large mountains on this moon.
