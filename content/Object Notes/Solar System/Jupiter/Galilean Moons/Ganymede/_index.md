1.	Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, and is larger than the planet Mercury.

2.	If Ganymede went around the Sun instead of Jupiter, it would be called a planet.

3.	It is about half ice and half rock.

4.	The surface of Ganymede is interesting: it has mountains, valleys, craters, lava flows, and light and dark regions.

5.	Ganymede probably also has a subsurface ocean.
