### Mare Information

1. These are the smooth dark areas on the moon.

2. They were formed about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago when lava flowed through cracks in the lunar surface and filled in the low-lying areas.

3. THE LAVA DID NOT COME FROM VOLCANOES. LUNAR GEOLOGISTS HAVE NOT SEEN ANY VOLCANOES ON THE MOON'S SURFACE NOR DO THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED.

4. The maria are younger than the highlands. This is evidenced by the smaller number of craters on them as compared to the highlands. Since cratering took place early in the moon's history, the maria at one time had as many craters as the highlands, but they were filled in by the lava.
