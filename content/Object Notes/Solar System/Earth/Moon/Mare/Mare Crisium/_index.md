### Mare Crisium Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Small lava plain 350 by 270 miles that is elongated in the east-west direction. Foreshortening makes it appear longer in the north-south direction. This is equal to the area of the state of Washington. Its apparent size is only half that much.

2. Notice mountainous surroundings. These mountains are 13,500 feet above the plain in the south and 14,400 on the north.

3. Notice the 3 craters on the floor - [Picard](/notes/object-notes/solar-system/earth/moon/craters/picard/#), Pierce, and Graham.
