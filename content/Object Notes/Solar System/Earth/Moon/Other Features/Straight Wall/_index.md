### Straight Wall Feature Information

1. This is a straight ridge about 70 miles long. The eastern ground is in some places about 1200 feet higher that the western. It can only be seen because of its shadow. The ridge is not vertical but rises with an angle of about 40 degrees. This is perhaps one of the steepest slopes on the moon.
