### Langrenus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  Langrenus is a prominent circular impact crater, but it appears oblong due to foreshortening. It lies on the eastern shore of the Mare Fecunditatis.

2.  The inner wall of Langrenus is wide and irregularly terraced, with an average width of about 20 kilometers. The walls of this crater are 6,500 feet above the surrounding plain.

3.  Note the complex rides and craterlet-chains on the outer slopes.

4.  The above craters are circular. They appear elliptical because they are near the edge of the moon and are therefore foreshortened.

5.  Its ray system has been traced for 500 miles, but they are narrow and weak. Look for the crater Ansgarius just south of Langrenus.

6.  The outer ramparts are irregular and hilly, and there is a bright, fragmented ray system spread across the maria to the west.

7.  The interior of the crater reflects more light than the surroundings, so the crater stands out prominently when the sun is overhead.

8.  The crater floor is covered by many boulders, and is slightly irregular in the northwest half. The central peaks rise about a kilometer above the floor, and a peak on the eastern rim ascends to an altitude of 3 km.

Dutch astronomer and cartographer

1. Michael van Langren was the youngest member of a family of Dutch cartographers and was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

2. His grandfather, Jacobus and his sons began producing both terrestrial as well as celestial globes in 1580.

3. Michael van Langren did not receive a university education however he did became a cartographer and engineer.

4. He served as the Royal Cosmographer and Mathematician to the King of Spain.

5.  Among his contributions were attempts to determine longitude by observing the position of the Moon. This led him to make the first ever map of the Moon, and he produced maps of the Moon at thirty different phases.

6.  He also assigned names to various lunar features, but few of these names were ever widely accepted because they were mostly related to the Spanish royal court. Ironically, the only lunar feature he named still bearing his designation is the crater he named after himself.

7.  He made various maps of the Spanish Netherlands, and produced plans for a port near Dunkirk, improvements to the port of Ostend, efforts to clear the canals of Antwerp, flood control concepts, and fortifications.
