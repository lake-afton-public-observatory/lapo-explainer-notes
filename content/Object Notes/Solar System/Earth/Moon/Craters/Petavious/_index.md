### Petavius Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Notice the cleft that runs from the central peak to the crater wall.

2. The outer wall of Petavius crater is unusually wide in proportion to the diameter, and displays a double rim along the south and west sides.

3. The height of the rim varies by as much as 50% from the lowest point, and a number of ridges radiate outward from the rim.

4. The convex crater floor has been resurfaced by lava flow, and displays a rille system named the Rimae Petavius.

5. The large central mountains are a prominent formation with multiple peaks, climbing 1.7 kilometers above the floor.

6. A deep fracture runs from the peaks toward the southwest rim of the crater.

French Jesuit theologian

1. Petau's claim to fame chiefly lies on his vast, but unfinished, De theologicis dogmatibus, the first systematic attempt ever made to treat the development of Christian doctrine from the historical point of view.
