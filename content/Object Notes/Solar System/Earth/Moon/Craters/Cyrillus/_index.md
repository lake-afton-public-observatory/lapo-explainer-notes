### Cyrillus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Cyrillus is a lunar impact crater located on the northwest edge of Mare Nectaris.
2. Intruding into the northeast rim is the equally large and younger [Theophilus](#theophilus) crater.

3. The crater walls are broken and dilapidated indicating that this crater is older than [Theophilus](#theophilus). Cyrillus' central peak is also smaller and less conspicuous.

4. To the south is another prominent crater named [Catharina](#catharina). Together these three craters form a prominent trio in the southeast quadrant of the moon.

5. The crater Cyrillus is named after Saint Cyril of Alexandria, a 4th century Coptic Pope and theologian.

6. The floor of Cyrillus contains a reduced central hill and the considerable crater Cyrillus A. The walls of the broken formation of Cyrillus remain intact up until the point of junction with [Theophilus](#theophilus).

7. Slightly northeast of its center, three rounded mountains rise to heights of 1,000 meters above the floor of [Theophilus](#theophilus).
