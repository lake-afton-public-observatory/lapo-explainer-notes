### Aristoteles Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Aristoteles crater is a lunar impact crater that lies near the southern edge of the Mare Frigoris, and to the east of the Montes Alpes mountain range. To the south of Aristoteles lies the slightly smaller crater Eudoxus, and these two form a distinctive pair for a telescope observer.

2. An arc of mountains between these craters bends to the west, before joining the walls. The smaller Mitchell crater is directly attached to the eastern rim of Aristoteles. To the west is the low, flooded Egede crater.

3. Observers have noted the crater wall of Aristoteles is slightly distorted into a rounded hexagon shape.

4. The inner walls are wide and finely terraced. The outer ramparts display a
   generally radial structure of hillocks through the extensive blanket of ejecta.

5. The crater floor is uneven, and covered in hilly ripples. Aristoteles does possess small central peaks and a row of hills and rocks radiate from the center, but they are somewhat offset to the south. The interior floor appears to have been filled with a layer of material, partially burying these projections.

Greek philosopher

1. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great.

2. He wrote on many different subjects, including physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology.

3. Aristotle (together with Socrates and Plato) is one of the most important philosophers in Western thought.

4. He was one of the first to systematize philosophy and science. His thinking on physics and science had a profound impact on medieval thought, which lasted until the Renaissance, and the accuracy of some of his biological observations was only confirmed in the last century.

5. His logical works contain the earliest formal study of logic known and were not superseded until the late nineteenth century.

6. In the Middle Ages, Aristotelian metaphysics had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions, and on Christian thought.

7. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.

8. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues, it is believed that the majority of his writings are now lost. His works have been lost and rediscovered several times, and it is believed that only about one fifth of the original works have survived.
