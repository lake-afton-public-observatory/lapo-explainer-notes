1. Note the string of craters on the floor. Clavius is the second largest crater on the moon; only Deslandres is larger.

2. On the north and south walls are deep craters, one Porter, and the other Rutherford.

3. In addition to the principal crater-chain, the floor also contains numerous small craters, hills, and some ridges but no clefts are seen.

4. Its walls slope downward for 15 miles.
