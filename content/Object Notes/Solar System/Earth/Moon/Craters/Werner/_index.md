### Werner Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Werner is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged south central highlands of the Moon. It is almost joined with Aliacensis crater to the southeast, and the pair form a rugged valley in the intervening gap.

2. Due west of Werner is the distorted Regiomontanus crater, and to the north is the remains of the Blanchinus crater. It is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

3. The rim of Werner crater shows little appearance of wear and is one of the most circular of all lunar craters. It is much younger and less eroded than the other surrounding large craters.

4. The interior wall is terraced, and there is a noticeable wall or ridge on the exterior.

5. There are several low rises on the crater floor and a notable central peak.

6. Its highly terraced walls attain peaks of almost 1,500 feet. The crater is 45 miles (70 kilometers) in diameter, and the difference in height between its rim and its deepest parts is 4.2 kilometers.

German parish priest in Nuremberg, mathematician, astronomer, geographer and skilled instrument maker.

1. His mathematical works were in the areas of spherical trigonometry, as well as conic sections.

2. This work further developed the suggestion of Regiomontanus that the occurrences of eclipses and the orbits of comets could be used to find longitude. This approach did not work out because the instruments being used were not accurate enough.

3. In the area of geography, Werner is best known for his work in translating Ptolemy’s work, Geographia in 1514.

4. He refined and promoted the Werner map projection, a cordiform (heart shape) projection map that had been developed by Johannes Stabius (Stab) of Vienna around 1500.

5. After its introduction by Werner in his 1514 book, the Werner projection was commonly used for world maps and some continental maps through the 16th century and into the 17th century.

6. By the 18th century, it was replaced by the Bonne projection for continental maps. The Werner projection is only used today for instructional purposes and as a novelty.

7. In the area of Meteorology, many consider Werner as a pioneer of modern meteorology and weather forecasting. Between 1513 and 1520, Johann Werner made the first regular observations of the weather conditions in Germany.
