### Catharina Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Catharina is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands.

2. It lies in a rugged stretch of land between the Rupes Altai scarp to the west and Mare Nectaris in the east.

3. With the large [Cyrillus](#cyrillus) and [Theophilus](#theophilus) craters in the north, it forms a prominent grouping that is framed by the curve of the Rupes Altai. Together they form a notable feature when the sun is at a low angle to the surface.

4. The three craters [Catharina](#catharina), [Cyrillus](#cyrillus), and [Theophilus](#theophilus) represent three different epochs of the moon's history.

5. There is also a distinct difference in the ages of these three craters, with the age increasing significantly from north to south.

6. The rim of Catharina is heavily worn and irregular, with most of the north wall incised by the worn ring of crater Catharina P.

7. The northeast wall is deeply impacted by several smaller craters. No terracing
   remains on the inner wall, and the outer rampart has been nearly eroded away.

8. The floor is relatively flat but rugged, with a curved ridge formed by Catharina P, and the remains of a smaller crater near the south wall. Nothing remains of a central peak.

Christian saint and martyr

1. Saint Catherine is claimed to have been a noted scholar in the early 4th century. She was one of the saints to speak to Saint Joan of Arc.

2. The Orthodox Churches venerate her as a "great martyr," and in the Roman Catholic Church, she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.

3.  Historians believe that Catherine ('the pure one') may not have existed and that she was more an ideal exemplary figure than an actual historical one.
