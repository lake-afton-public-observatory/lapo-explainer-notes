### Hipparchus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Hipparchus is the degraded remnant of a lunar crater; a vast ruined mountain-walled plain, 100 miles across, with the walls highest on the west. On the interior are partial rings, craterlets, shallow depressions on the east, and a cleft on the west.

2. It is located to the southeast of Sinus Medii, near the center of the visible Moon. To the south is the prominent Albategnius crater, and to the southwest lies Ptolemaeus crater, a feature of comparable dimensions to Hipparchus.

3. This feature is an ancient crater that has been subject to considerable modification due to subsequent impacts.

4. The western rim of Hipparchus has been all but worn away from impact erosion, and only low hills and rises on the surface remain to outline the feature. The wall to the east is somewhat more intact, but it too is heavily worn.

5. A pair of deep clefts lie in the western wall. These parallel a set of scars running through the south central highlands.

6. The crater floor has been partially resurfaced by basaltic lava flows. The southwest part of the floor, however, is slightly raised and much more rugged than the remainder. A few small rises and the raised partial rim of a flooded crater are all that remain of a central mountain mass.

7. Gaps in the northwest rim of Hipparchus crater rim form valleys that connect with the maria to the northwest.

8. Look for Horrocks, 17 by 19 miles, and 9,200 feet deep.

9. Also note the small crater Lyot on the floor.

1. Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician of the Hellenistic period.

2. Hipparchus was born in Nicaea (now Iznik, Turkey), and probably died on the island of Rhodes.

3. He is known to have been a working astronomer from 147 BC to 127 BC. Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer and, by some, the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity.

4. He was the first Greek that made quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon which survive to this day.

5. He possessed a trigonometric table, and appears to have solved some problems of spherical trigonometry.

6. It is thought that, with his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometric tables, he may have been the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses.

7. Some of his other achievements include the discovery of precession, the compilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world, and possibly the invention of the astrolabe.

8. It would be three centuries before Claudius Ptolemaeus' synthesis of astronomy would supersede the work of Hipparchus.
