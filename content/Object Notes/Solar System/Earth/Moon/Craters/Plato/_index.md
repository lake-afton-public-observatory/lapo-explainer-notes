1. This is a mountain-walled plain. It shows up rather well during full moon.

### Plato Crater Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Plato is the maria surfaced remains of a lunar impact crater.

2. It is located on the northeastern shore of the Mare Imbrium, at the western extremity of the Montes Alpes mountainous range.

3. The age of the Plato walled plain is about 3.84 billion years; younger than Mare Imbrium to the south.

4. The rim is irregular with jagged peaks that project prominent shadows across the crater floor when the sun is at a low angle.

5. Sections of the inner wall display signs of past slumping, most notably a large triangular slide along the western side.

6. The rim of Plato is circular, but from the Earth it appears oval due to foreshortening.

7. The flat floor of Plato crater has a relatively low albedo, making it appear dark in comparison to the surrounding rugged terrain.

8. The floor is free of significant impact craters and lacks a central peak. However there are a few small craterlets scattered across the floor.

9. The astronomer Johannes Hevelius originally called this feature the 'Greater Black Lake'.

Classical Greek philosopher and mathematician.

1. Together with his teacher, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle, Plato helped to lay the philosophical foundations of Western culture.

2. Plato was the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the western world.

3. Plato was originally a student of Socrates, and was as much influenced by his thinking as by what he saw as his teacher's unjust death.

4. Plato's brilliance as a writer and thinker can be witnessed by reading his Socratic dialogues.

5. Interestingly, although there is little question that Plato lectured at the Academy that he founded, the pedagogical function of his dialogues, if any, is not known with any degree of certainty.

6. Plato’s dialogues have been used to teach a range of subjects, primarily philosophy, logic, rhetoric, and mathematics.
