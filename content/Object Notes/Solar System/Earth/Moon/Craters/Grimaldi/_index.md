### Grimaldi Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Grimaldi is a large basin located near the western limb of the Moon. Look for the dark ellipse which marks the heavily stained floor.

2. Note the low mountain ring and dark floor. (Darker than Plato.) Grimaldi may be the connecting link between the maria and the mountain-walled plains.

3. It lies to the southwest of the Oceanus Procellarum, and southeast of Riccioli crater. Between Oceanus Procellarum is the Damoiseau crater, and to the north is Lohrmann crater.

4. The inner wall of Grimaldi has been so heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts that it forms a low, irregular ring of hills, ridges and peaks, rather than a typical crater rim. However, there are peaks remaining that reach heights of over 2 kilometers.

5. The floor is the most notable feature of this crater, forming a flat, relatively smooth and featureless surface with a particularly low albedo.

6. The dark shade of the floor contrasts with the brighter surroundings, making the crater easy to locate.

7. The approximate diameter of the inner rim is 140 kilometers. Beyond the basin are the scattered remnants of an outer wall, which has a diameter of 220 kilometers.

8. This exterior rim is more intact to the north and west of the crater than elsewhere.

Italian mathematician and physicist

1. Between 1640 and 1650, working with Riccioli, he investigated the free fall of objects, confirming that the distance of fall was proportional to the square of the time taken.

2. In astronomy, he built and used instruments to measure geological features on the Moon, and drew an accurate map or selenograph which was published by Riccioli.

3. He was the first to make accurate observations on the diffraction of light (although by some accounts Leonardo da Vinci had earlier noted it), and coined the word 'diffraction'.

4. Later physicists used his work as evidence that light was a wave, and Isaac Newton used it to arrive at his more comprehensive theory of light.
