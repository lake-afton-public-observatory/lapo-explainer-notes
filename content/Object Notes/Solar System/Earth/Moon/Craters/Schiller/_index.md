### Schiller Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Schiller is an oddly shaped impact crater bearing a slight resemblance to a footprint left by a shoe. The rim is elongated and may be a fusion of 2 or more craters.

2. There is a linear ridge formation dividing the northwest end of the crater floor.

3. At the southwestern end of the crater is a narrow valley connecting to another smaller crater.
