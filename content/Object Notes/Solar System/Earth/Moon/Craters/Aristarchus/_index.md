### Aristarchus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Aristarchus is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon's near side. Look for bands running from the peak to the eastern wall soon after sunrise.

2. It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface, with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features.

3. The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, and is dazzling in a large telescope. It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated.

4. The crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous rilles.

5. Aristarchus was originally named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos by the Italian map maker Giovanni Riccioli. He gave the spot shaped telescopic features (later called craters) eponyms of noted astronomers and philosophers. Although widely adopted, the name only became an official international standard by a vote of the IAU General Assembly in 1935.

Greek astronomer and mathematician,

1. Aristarchus was born on the island of Samos, in Greece.

2. He was the first person to present an explicit argument for a heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe (hence he is sometimes known as the "Greek Copernicus").

3. He both identified the central fire with the Sun, as well as putting other planets in correct order from the Sun.

4. His astronomical ideas were rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy until they were successfully revived by Copernicus and extensively developed and built upon by Kepler and Isaac Newton nearly 2000 years later.
