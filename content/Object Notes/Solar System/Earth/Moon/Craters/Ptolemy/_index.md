### Ptolemy Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. The interior of the mountain-walled plain has been filled with lava to approximately the outside level. Look for the crater Ammonius1, six miles across and 3,900 feet deep, northeast of center.

2. This is a great walled plain. On the surface, which is very dark at sunrise, are over 200 objects including craterlets, shallow depressions, ridges, and a cleft on the east. The highest peak on the walls rises 9,000 feet.

3. Note that someone standing near the center would not see the mountainous border since it would be below the horizon. The horizon would be about 2 miles from you.

4. In the past this crater was identified as Ptolemaeus A, before being renamed by the IAU in 1976. (source: https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/236)
