### Picard Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Picard Crater is a lunar impact crater that lies in the western part of the Mare Crisium.

2. It is the largest crater on the mare and is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

3. Inside Picard is a series of terraces that seismologists have attributed to a collapse of the crater floor.

4. The lowest point on the crater floor is approximately 2000 meters below its rim.

5. The crater rim of Picard is well-defined and shows little sign of wear, having a sharp-edged appearance. It has a small hill at the center.

French Astronomer, priest and Geodesist

1. Jean-Felix Picard was not only a French astronomer but a priest as well, born in La Flèche, where he studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand.

2. As a geodesist, he was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted 1669-70. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. Today, the polar radius is measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value.

3. Picard made many improvements to the tools he used to make his measurements of one degree of the Earth’s latitude. This resulted in a much smaller margin of error than Tyco Brahe’s measurements. Picard’s measurements were 36 times more accurate.

4. Picard collaborated and corresponded with many scientists of his day, including Newton, Christian Huygens, Römer, Bartholin, Hudde, and even his main competitor, Giovanni Cassini.

5. These correspondences led to Picard's contributions to areas of science outside the area of geodesy, such as the aberration of light he observed while in Uraniborg, or his discovery of mercurial phosphorescence upon his observance of the faint glowing of a barometer. This discovery led to Newton's studies of spectrometry.

6. Picard also developed the system of right ascension for measuring positions of celestial objects.
