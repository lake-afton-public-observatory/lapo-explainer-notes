### Furnerius Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Furnerius belongs to a subgroup of large craters called, mountain-walled plains. They are characterized by their shallow size, smooth floors, absence of a central mountain peak, and their polygonal (rather than circular or elliptical) outline. It appears that the crater was formed by dropping its floor rather than having their walls thrown up by some explosive action.

2. On the interior are craters, one with a central peak, ridges, and clefts. The most prominent cleft passes through the north wall. On the west, there is a gorge while in the south there is the crater Fraunhofer (33 miles across and 7900 feet deep).
