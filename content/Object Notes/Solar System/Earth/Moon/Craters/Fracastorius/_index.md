### Fracastorius Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Located just south of the Apollo 11 landing site.

2. Fracastorius is the lava flooded remnant of an ancient lunar impact crater located at the southern edge of Mare Nectaris. To the northwest of this formation lies the Beaumont crater, while to the northeast is Rosse.

3. Notice that its northern wall has disappeared under the molten lava of the mare that flooded its interior, leaving only mounds appearing in the lunar mare to mark the outline. This is a fine example of a ruined ring. On the floor are many objects, a circle of hills near the center, craterlets, and clefts. Of the latter, the most prominent lies on the south where it crosses the floor.

4. The lava that formed [Mare Nectaris](/object-notes/solar-system/earth/moon/mare/mare-nectaris/#) also invaded this crater, so the structure now forms a bay like extension.

5. The remainder of the rim is heavily worn and covered in lesser impact craters, leaving little of the original rim intact.

6. The maximum elevation of the rim is 2.4 km.

7. The Fracastorius crater has no central peak, but a long, slender rille runs across the middle of the floor in a generally east west direction.

### Namesake: Girolamo Fracastoro (Fracastorius) (1478 - 1553)

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

Italian physician, mathematician, geographer, astronomer, poet and atomist.

7. Born of an ancient family in Verona, and educated at Padua where at 19 he was appointed professor at the University.

8. On account of his eminence in the practice of medicine, he was elected physician of the Council of Trent.

9. A bronze statue was erected in his honor by the citizens of Padua, while his native city commemorated their great compatriot by a marble statue.

10. He lived and practiced in his hometown.

11. In 1546 he proposed that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable tiny particles or "spores" that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact or even without contact over long distances.

12. His theory remained influential for nearly three centuries, before being displaced by germ theory.

13. The name for syphilis is derived from Fracastoro's 1530 epic poem in three books, Syphilis sive morbus gallicus ("Syphilis or The French Disease"), about a shepherd named Syphilus. The poem suggests using mercury and "guaiaco" as a cure.

14. His 1546 book (De contagione "On Contagion") also gave the first description for typhus. The collected works of Fracastoro appeared for the first time in 1555.
