### Tycho Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Tycho is a prominent lunar impact crater located in the southern lunar highlands, named after Tycho Brahe and is one of the youngest craters on the moon. Its walls are 13 miles thick.

2. Note the extensive ray system (especially during full moon). Some of the rays are more than 1,000 miles long.

3. The surface around Tycho has numerous craters of various differing radii, many overlapping older craters. Some of the smaller craters are secondary craters formed from larger chunks of ejecta from Tycho. To the south is Street crater; to the east Pictet, and to the north northeast is Sasserides crater.

4. Tycho is a (relatively) very young crater, with an estimated age of 108 million years, based on analysis of samples of the crater rays recovered during the Apollo 17 mission.

5. This age suggests that the impactor may have been a member of the Baptistina family of asteroids, but as the composition of the impactor is unknown this is currently conjecture.

6. It is also speculated that a larger asteroid from the same family may have been the impactor responsible for creating Chicxulub Crater on Earth 65 million years ago, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.

7. The crater is sharply defined and free of the wear that affects older craters. The interior has a high albedo that is prominent when the sun is overhead, and the crater is surrounded by a distinctive ray system forming long spokes that reach as far away as 1,500 kilometers.

8. The walls beyond the rim have a lower albedo than the interior for a distance of over a hundred kilometers, and are free of the ray markings that lie beyond. This darker rim may have been formed from minerals excavated during the impact.

9. Its inner wall is slumped and terraced, sloping down to a rough but nearly flat floor exhibiting small, knobby domes. The floor displays signs of past volcanism, most likely from rock melt caused by the impact.

10. Detailed photographs of the floor show that it is covered in a criss crossing array of cracks and small hills. The central peaks rise 1.6 kilometers above the floor, and a lesser peak stands just to the northeast of the primary massif.

11. Infrared observations of the lunar surface during an eclipse have demonstrated that Tycho cools at a slower rate than other parts of the surface, making the crater a "hot spot". This effect is caused by the difference in materials that cover the crater.

### Namesake: Tycho Brahe (December 14, 1546 – October 24, 1601)

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

Danish nobleman, astronomer, astrologer and alchemist.

1. Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg, an early research institute, where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements of the heavens.

2. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system.

3. From 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler, who would later use Tycho's astronomical information to develop his own theories of astronomy.

4. He is credited with the most accurate astronomical observations of his time, and the data were used by his assistant Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion.

5. No one before Tycho had attempted to make so many redundant observations. In addition, the mathematical tools to take advantage of these careful observations had not yet been developed.

6. He did what others before him were unable or unwilling to do — to catalogue the planets and stars with enough accuracy so as to determine whether the Ptolemaic or Copernican system was more valid in describing the heavens.
