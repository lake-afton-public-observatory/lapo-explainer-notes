### Gassendi Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. On the interior is a central mountain group, 4,000 feet high which is the remains of an inner ring. Craterlets, ridges, and a fine system of clefts can also be seen.

2. Look for Gassendi A (20 by 24 miles, 8500 feet deep) on the north wall. On the south, the crater's walls have been melted down to hills for a 30 mile stretch.
