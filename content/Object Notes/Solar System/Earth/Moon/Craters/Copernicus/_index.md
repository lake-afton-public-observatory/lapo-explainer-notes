### Copernicus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Copernicus is a prominent lunar impact crater located in eastern Oceanus Procellarum. Notice the central peak with three distinct peaks. Also notice the ray system.

2. The crater Copernicus is estimated to be about 800 million years old, and typifies craters that formed during the Copernican period in that it has a prominent ray system.

3. Copernicus is visible using binoculars, and is located slightly northwest of the center of the Moon's Earth facing hemisphere.

4. Due to its relative youth, the crater has remained in a relatively pristine shape since it formed.

5. The circular rim has a discernible hexagonal form, with a terraced inner wall and a 30 km wide, sloping rampart that descends nearly a kilometer to the surrounding maria.

6. There are three distinct terraces visible, and arc shaped landslides due to slumping of the inner wall as the crater debris subsided.

7. The crater rays spread as far as 800 kilometers across the surrounding maria, overlaying rays from the Aristarchus and Kepler craters. The rays are less distinct than the long, linear rays around Tycho crater, instead forming a nebulous pattern with plumy markings.

Astronomer, physician, classical scholar, translator, Catholic cleric, jurist, governor, military leader, diplomat and economist.

1. Copernicus was the first astronomer to formulate a scientifically based heliocentric cosmology that displaced the Earth from the center of the universe.

2. His epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining epiphany that began the Scientific Revolution.

3. Although Greek, Indian and Muslim individuals published heliocentric hypotheses centuries before Copernicus, his publication of a scientific theory of heliocentrism, demonstrating that the motions of celestial objects can be explained without putting the Earth at rest in the center of the universe,

4. Copernicus’ book stimulated further scientific investigations, and became a landmark in the history of modern science that is known as the Copernican Revolution.

5. Amid his extensive responsibilities, astronomy figured as little more than an avocation — yet it was in that field that he made his mark upon the world.
