### Archimedes Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Archimedes Crater is a large lunar impact crater on the eastern edges of the Mare Imbrium.

2. East of Archimedes is the Autolycus crater, and the stretch of lunar surface between these two formations was the crash landing site of the Luna 2 landing craft. This was the first robotic craft to reach the surface of the moon, landing September 13, 1959.

3. To the northwest is the prominent Aristillus crater. The lava plain between Archimedes, Aristillus, and Autolycus forms the Sinus Lunicus bay of Mare Imbrium.

4. A wrinkle ridge leads away from Archimedes toward the north northwest, crossing this maria.

5. The diameter of Archimedes is the largest of any crater on the Mare Imbrium. The rim has a significant outer rampart brightened with ejecta and the upper portion of a terraced inner wall, but lacks the ray system associated with younger craters.

6. A triangular promontory extends 30 kilometers from the southeast of the rim.

7. The interior of the crater lacks a central peak, and is flooded with maria. It is devoid of significant raised features, although there are a few tiny meteor craters near the rim.

8. The lava floor is similar to that of Plato but much lighter and smoother.

### Namesake: Archimedes of Syracuse (287 BC â€“ 212 BC)

Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer.

1. Archimedes is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity.

2. Among his advances in physics are the foundations of hydrostatics and the explanation of the principle of the lever.

3. He is credited with designing innovative machines, including siege engines and the screw pump that bears his name.

4. Archimedes is also considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.

5. He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi.

6. He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.

7. Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed.

8. Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere inscribed within a cylinder. Archimedes had proved that the sphere has two thirds of the volume and surface area of the cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded this as the greatest of his mathematical achievements.
