### Craters Information

1. Craters were formed when pieces of rock struck the moon and left large holes.

2. The size of the typical crater visible on the moon is about 50 miles. The smallest craters that can be seen with the telescope are a few miles across. However, astronauts saw craters as small as a few inches across.

3. Over 500 thousand craters can be seen on the moon with the largest telescope on Earth.

4. If the area you have chosen has two craters which overlap, you may wish to ask which one was formed first and why.

5. If the crater you have chosen has a mountain peak or peaks in the center, you may wish to ask how the mountain peak got there. If you do ask, it is usually best to start by asking how craters are made and if that explanation is consistent with a mountain in the center. Of course, the mountain peak is formed when the material that originally flowed away from the impact site flows back in to fill up the hole. This is similar to dropping a pebble into a bucket of water.

6. The best times to look at cratered or highland areas on the moon are a few days before or after first and third quarter. Since sunlight strikes the moon's surface at a shallow angle it produces a lot of shadows which highlight the surface.

7. Often light colored material which appears to have been thrown out of the crater can be seen around the rim of the crater. This is indeed material that was ejected from the crater during its formation. These are called ray craters.

8. An interesting piece of information about the larger craters (more than 40 miles or so) is that if you were standing in the middle of them, you could not see the rim. It would be below your horizon.
