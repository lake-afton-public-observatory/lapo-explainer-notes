### Kepler Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Kepler is a young lunar impact crater that lies between the Oceanus Procellarum to the west and Mare Insularum in the east. To the southeast is the Encke crater.

2. Kepler is most notable for the prominent ray system that covers the surrounding maria. The rays extend for well over 300 kilometers, overlapping the rays from other craters.

3. Kepler has a small rampart of ejecta surrounding the exterior of its high rim. The outer wall is not quite circular, and possesses a slightly polygonal form.

4. The interior walls of Kepler are slumped and slightly terraced, descending to an uneven floor and a minor central rise.

5. One of the rays from Tycho crater, when extended across the Oceanus Procellarum, intersects Kepler crater. This was a factor in the choice of the crater's name when Giovanni Riccioli was creating his system of lunar nomenclature, as Kepler used the observations of Tycho Brahe while devising his three laws of planetary motion.

German mathematician, astronomer and astrologer, and a key figure in the 17th century astronomical revolution.

1. He is best known for his laws of planetary motion, codified by later astronomers based on his works Astronomia nova, Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy.

2. Before Kepler, planets' paths were computed by combinations of the circular motions of the celestial orbs. After Kepler, astronomers gradually shifted their attention from orbs to orbits — paths that could be represented mathematically as an ellipse.

3. Kepler's laws also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.

4. During his career, Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, Austria, an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe, the court mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II, a mathematics teacher in Linz, Austria, and an adviser to General Wallenstein.

5. He also did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, and helped to legitimize the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei.

6. Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of the more prestigious discipline of natural philosophy).

7. Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason.
