### Eudoxus Crater Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Eudoxus is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies to the east of the northern tip of the Montes Caucasus range.

2. It is located to the south of the prominent Aristoteles crater in the northern regions of the visible Moon.

3. To the south is the ruined formation of Alexander crater, and the small Lamèch crater lies to the southwest.

4. The rim of Eudoxus has a series of terraces on the interior wall, and slightly worn ramparts about the exterior.

5. Eudoxus and Aristotle are both noted for their massive walls.

6. It lacks a single central peak, but has a cluster of low hills about the mid point of the floor. The remainder of the interior floor is relatively level.

7. Notice the many hills on the interior, some of which are arranged in a ring. The southern part is very hilly. In the east, there are also many hills and mountains further east. One eastern mountain, 7,000 feet high, is cut through by a cleft.

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Greek astronomer, mathematician, physician, scholar and student of Plato.

2. In mathematical astronomy his fame is due to the introduction of the astronomical globe, and his early contributions to understanding the movement of the planets.

3. His work on proportions shows tremendous insight into numbers; it allows rigorous treatment of continuous quantities and not just whole or rational numbers.

4. The work of Eudoxus and Archimedes as precursors of calculus was only exceeded in mathematical sophistication and rigour by Indian Mathematician Bhaskara and later by Newton.

5. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of him is obtained from secondary sources.

6. Eudoxus first travelled to Tarentum, Italy to study mathematics. While in Italy, Eudoxus visited Sicily where he studied medicine.

7. At the age of 23, he traveled to Athens to study with the followers of Socrates. He eventually became the pupil of Plato, with whom he studied for several months, but due to a disagreement they had a falling out.

8. Eudoxus was quite poor and could only afford an apartment at the Piraeus. To attend Plato's lectures, he walked the seven miles each direction, each day.

9. Due to his poverty, his friends raised funds sufficient to send him to Heliopolis, Egypt to pursue his study of astronomy and mathematics where he lived there 16 months.

10. Eudoxus eventually returned to his native Cnidus, where he served in the city assembly, built an observatory and continued writing and lecturing on theology, astronomy and meteorology.

11. An algebraic curve (the Kampyle of Eudoxus) is named after him.
