The phases of the Moon, in the sequence of their occurrence (from New Moon to New Moon):

| **Phase** | **Description**    |
|:---:|:---|
|<img src="/images/newmoon.gif" width="75" title="New Moon"/>        | **New Moon**<br/>(0% Illumination)<br/>The Moon's unilluminated side is facing the Earth.<br/>The Moon is not visible (except during a solar eclipse).                                                        |
|<img src="/images/waxingcrescent.gif" width="75" title="Waxing Crescent"/> | **Waxing Crescent**<br/>(5-days old - 25%)<br/>The Moon appears to be partly but less than one-half illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is increasing.    |
|<img src="/images/firstquarter.gif" width="75" title="First Quarter"/>   | **First Quarter**<br/>(9 days old – 50%)<br/>One-half of the Moon appears to be illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is increasing.                        |
|<img src="/images/waxinggibbous.gif" width="75" title="Waxing Gibbous"/>  | **Waxing Gibbous**<br/>(13 days old – 75%)<br/>The Moon appears to be more than one-half but not fully illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is increasing  |
|<img src="/images/fullmoon.gif" width="75" title="Full Moon"/>       | **Full Moon**<br/>(15 days old – 100%)<br/>The Moon's illuminated side is facing the Earth.<br/>The Moon appears to be completely illuminated by direct sunlight.                                             |
|<img src="/images/waninggibbous.gif" width="75" title="Waning Gibbous"/>  | **Waning Gibbous**<br/>(19 days old – 75%)<br/>The Moon appears to be more than one-half but not fully illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is decreasing. |
|<img src="/images/lastquarter.gif" width="75" title="Last Quarter"/>    | **Last Quarter**<br/>(24 days old – 50%)<br/>One-half of the Moon appears to be illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is decreasing.                        |
|<img src="/images/waningcrescent.gif" width="75" title="Waning Crescent"/> | **Waning Crescent**<br/>(29 days old – 25%)<br/>The Moon appears to be partly but less than one-half illuminated by direct sunlight.<br/>The fraction of the Moon's disk that is illuminated is decreasing.   |
|<img src="/images/newmoon.gif" width="75" title="New Moon"/>        | **New Moon**<br/>(29.5 days old - 0%)<br/>The Moon's unilluminated side is facing the Earth.<br/>The Moon is not visible (except during a solar eclipse).  |

<br/>

<p>Following Waning Crescent is New Moon, beginning a repetition of the complete phase cycle of 29.5-days average duration. The time in days counted from the time of New Moon is called the Moon's "age". Each complete cycle of phases is called a "lunation".</p>
