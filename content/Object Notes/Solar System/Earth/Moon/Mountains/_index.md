1. Mountains on the moon were formed very differently from the mountains on Earth.

2. Mountains on Earth are formed when two plates meet; one can be forced to go over the other (as is the case with the Cascade mountains in the Western United States); or they can scrunch up as in the case of the Himalayas in Asia. This is because Earth is an active world with plate tectonics.

3. The Moon has no plate tectonics. Lunar mountains are the rims of ancient large craters. Part of the rims and crater floors were covered by lava billions of years ago.
