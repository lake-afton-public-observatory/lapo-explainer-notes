### In the telescope

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

1.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  The brighter star should appear yellow and the dimmer star blue.

### Albireo Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	The 5th brightest star in Cygnus, Albireo is one of the best known contrast optical double stars.
 
1.	The yellow star is actually a multiple star system: the star and an unseen companion orbit each other.

1.  In Arabic, “Minqar al-Dajajah,” meaning “the hen’s beak” - otherwise known as the “beak star”.

2. Light we’re seeing left in 1586 AD:
    * 1580 - Sir Francis Drake completes his circumnavigation of the globe…his is the 2nd journey to do that and the first under the same commander.
    * 1582 – the Gregorian calendar is implemented
    * 1582 – Shakespeare marries Anne Hathaway
    * 1580s – Chocolate is introduced commercially to Europe
    * 1587 – Mary Queen of Scots is beheaded
    * 1587 – English settlers arrive at Roanoake Island in North Carolina and re-establish the deserted colony

3.  If they are orbiting each other (we don’t know for certain), their orbital period is at least 75,000 years

4.  Beta<sup>1</sup> Cyg or Albireo A (the golden amber star):

    |   |   |
    |---:|:---|
    |**Color**|Orange, K3 II, bright giant
    |**Luminosity**| 889 Suns; 1460 Suns total
    |**Diameter**| 66 Suns
    |**Absolute Magnitude**|-2.55 visual; -3.16 total|
    |  |  |

    a. In 1976, it was discovered that this is a binary system in itself, separated by 40 AU, and orbiting each other every 100-200 years.  Our telescope can’t distinguish between them. 

      * The brighter star is a helium-fusing giant, class K3 (orange)

        |   |   |
        |---:|:---|
        |**Temperature**| 7440⁰ F
        |**Luminosity**| 950 Suns
        |**Diameter**| 50 Suns
        |**Mass**| 5 Suns
        |   |   |

      * The other is a hydrogen-fusing main sequence, class B9 (blue)

        |   |   |
        |---:|:---|
        |**Temperature**| 19,340⁰ F
        |**Luminosity**| 100 Suns
        |**Mass**| 3.2 Suns
        |   |   |

5.  Beta<sup>2</sup> Cyg or Albireo B (the blue-white star):

    |   |   |
    |---:|:---|
    |**Color**|B8 Ve, main sequence
    |**Temperature**|20,100⁰ F
    |**Luminosity**| 117 Suns visual; 229 Suns total
    |**Diameter**| 3.88 Suns
    |**Absolute Magnitude**| -0.35 visual; -1.15 total
    |   |   |

    a.  Very fast spinning star (150 miles per second), rotation period of about 14 hours, this causes a gas disk around it

    b.  From Albireo B, Albireo A would appear as brilliant orange and blue points about ½ degree apart.  The orange star would shine with light equal to about 35 full moons, and the blue/white companion about ½ half that.
