### General Information

1. On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two rocky planets orbiting the pulsar **PSR 1257+12** in the constellation Virgo. This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Because they are constantly bombarded by radiation from the dead neutron star that they orbit, these rocky planets cannot support organic life.

1. A year later, the planet **PSR B1620-26 b** is found orbiting a binary system composed of a pulsar and a white dwarf. Located 1,170 light years from Earth, the planet, which is about two and a half times the size of Jupiter, takes over 100 Earth years to complete a single orbit. It is also the first planet found in a star cluster (globular cluster M4).

1. To date, there have been over 5,000 exoplanets discovered, and growing. The search continues for planets orbiting other stars that are in the "Goldilocks Zone", or habitable zone, is the range of distance with the right temperatures for water to remain liquid. 

1.  On 29 September 2010, a team of planet-hunting astronomers, utilizing the HIRES spectrometer on the W.M. Keck Observatory’s Keck I Telescope, has announced the discovery of an Earth-sized planet orbiting a nearby star. The new planet, known as **Gliese 581g**, is at a distance that places it squarely in the middle of the star’s “habitable zone” where liquid water could exist on the planet’s surface. The published paper reports the discovery of not one but two new planets around the nearby red dwarf star known as **Gliese 581**, located 20 light years away from Earth in the constellation Libra. This brings to six the number of known planets around this star.
