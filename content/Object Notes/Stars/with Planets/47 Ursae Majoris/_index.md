1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope a white point of light should be seen.

3.  Please note: the planet cannot be seen through any telescope.

### 47 Ursae Majoris Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  There are actually three planets orbiting this star.

2.  The first planet, 47 Ursae Majoris b, was discovered in 1996 by a team of astronomers led by Paul Butler and Geoff Marcy.

	a.  Planet b is just over 2 AU from its star.

	b.  This planet takes about 1090 days to complete an orbit.

	c.  The planet is about 2.5 times as massive as Jupiter. 

1.  The second planet, 47 Ursae Majoris c, was discovered in 2001.<br/>The same team, joined by Debra Fischer, discovered planet c.

	a.  Planet c is about 3.7 AU from its star.

	b.  This planet takes nearly 2600 days to complete an orbit.

	c.  The planet is about 0.76 times as massive as Jupiter.

1.  A third planet, 47 Ursae Majoris was discovered in 2010 announced by Debra Fisher and P.C. Gregory.  

	a.  Using the Bayesian Kepler Periodogram model of planetary systems, it was found that it is 100,000 times more likely to have three planets than two planets so they looked for a third after finding c. 

	b.  The planet 11.6 AU from its star (1.078 billion miles).

	c.  Planet d takes 14,002 days (38.33 years) to complete an orbit.

	d.  The planet is about 1.64 times as massive as Jupiter.  

	e.  It is the longest-period planet discovered by using the radial velocity method
