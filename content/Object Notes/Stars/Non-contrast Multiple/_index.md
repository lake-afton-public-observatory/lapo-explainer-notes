### General Information

1.  A multiple star is simply two or more stars which revolve around each other much like the Earth orbits the sun. 

2.  With the unaided eye, they can't be seen as individual stars because they are too far away from us and too close to each other.  A good analogy is the headlights of a distant car.

3.  Perhaps as many as one-third to half of the stars in the sky are multiple stars.

4.  At least one multiple star system has as many as 9 components. 

5.  Note that the sun is just an ordinary star.
