### In the telescope

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

1.	When people look through the telescope, two bright bluish points of light should be seen.  A third faint star may also be seen.

### Castor Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	Castor is the 17th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (24th brightest in the night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

1.	Through a telescope, it can be seen that Castor is more than one star - there are actually six stars in this system.
 
    1.  The two visible bright stars (mag. 2.0 and 2.8) form a multiple star system. Both stars are very similar in appearance, but a medium sized telescope is necessary to split them.

        a.  They are separated by about 107 AU (Pluto’s distance from our sun is 40 AU).

        b.  This was the first real multiple star to be recognized.  (Accounts differ as to who realized it first.  Either Reverend John Michell realized it in 1767, or Sir William Herschel realized it and announced it in 1803. It may have been resolved as a double star as early as 1678 by Giovanni Cassini.)

        c.  It was actually the first gravitationally bound objects observed beyond our solar system.

	    d.  A faint third star may be seen (mag. 9.0).  It doesn’t seem to be physically associated with the two bright stars.

1.	Each of the three stars are themselves spectroscopic binaries -- a double-double-double star system!

    1.  Castor A is really two almost identical stars which take about 9 days to orbit each other.

    1.  Castor C is really two, much cooler and lower mass stars (M1), which take a mere 20 hours to orbit each other.
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

        - A pair of red dwarfs that lie about 1,100 AU from the brighter pair.

        - Castor C orbits A & B about every 10,000 years.

        - This is one of only a few known eclipsing binary stars that are both red dwarfs.

        - One or both of them are flare stars, meaning they will sometimes suddenly give off large amounts of surface magnetic energy. (Proxima Centauri is also a flare star.) 

        - Combined luminosity of 0.05 Suns

1.	In ancient Greece, sailors looked to the twins Castor and Pollux for protection against the dangers of being at sea.

### Gemini – the Twins

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  Castor & Pollux are not related gravitationally.  Pollux is 34 light years away, Castor is 52.  Pollux is an orange giant star.  Castor is a white star.

2.  Castor’s designation is Alpha Gem, but it is actually fainter than Beta Gem (Pollux).  It’s likely that either Castor or Pollux has changed in luminosity over the centuries.

3.  In Greek mythology Castor & Pollux are really half-brothers, with their mother being Leda.  Pollux’s father is Zeus, so Pollux is immortal.  Castor’s father was King Tyndareus, king of Sparta.  Their sister was Helen of Troy.

4.  Both Castor A & B are about 370 million years old.  Castor C presents a problem however.  At 370 million years old, Castor C should be 20% larger than it is.  Otherwise, it looks to be only 30-85 million years old ... and we’re not sure how it got connected with this system.
