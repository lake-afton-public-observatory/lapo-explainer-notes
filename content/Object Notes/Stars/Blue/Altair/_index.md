### In the telescope

1. Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2. When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.

### Altair Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1. Altair is the 8th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night-time sky (12th brightest in night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2. Altair rotates on its axis very quickly.

      a.  Altair takes just 10-1/2 hours to rotate.  Our smaller sun takes thirty days.

      b.  Since the star is gaseous, and because it spins so fast, Altair is a bit squashed: Altair’s equatorial diameter is about 14% larger than its polar diameter.

      c.  By comparison, Jupiter is also gaseous and slightly squashed, but its equatorial diameter is only about 3% larger than its polar diameter.

As a result, the equatorial diameter is nearly twice the polar diameter.” – BUT these speeds are debated: 118 mi/sec to 155 mi/sec.  <br/>Also, Altair is flattened, but not nearly that much. <br/>See van Belle, G. T., Ciardi, D. R., Thompson, R. R., Akeson, R. L., and Lada, E. A., “Altair’s Oblateness and Rotation Velocity from Long-Baseline Interferometry,” [ApJ 559, 1155–1164 (Oct. 2001)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/322340)<br/><br/>Web search indicated equatorial diameter only 14% larger, and spin is 10.4 hours.  One site with this info is [www.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2001/release_2001_150.html)<br/>2.   previously: 15th brightest  – BUT with Hipparcos, these brightness “ranks”  |
