### In the telescope

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.

### Vega Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  Vega is the brightest member of the summer triangle, and is the 3rd brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (5th brightest star when including Southern Hemisphere bright stars).
   
2.  It was the pole star about 12,000 years ago at a distance of about 4.5 degrees from the actual pole.  It will be the pole again in another 12,000 years.

3.  The sun and solar system are moving toward Vega at 12 miles per second.  It would take 450,000 years to get there but since Vega is also moving, it will no longer be there.

4.  Vega was the first star to be photographed.  The 100 second exposure was taken on July 16-17, 1850 at Harvard Observatory.

5.  Vega was also the first star to have a car named after it: the Chevrolet Vega.

6.  Vega is surrounded by a circumstellar dust disk, which could be a stage in planet formation.
