### In the telescope

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.

3.  Both stars have dimmer companion stars.  They may be seen.

### Beta Scorpii Information

1.  The brighter star, Star A, is actually a multiple star.
 
    a.  However, we can’t see its companion: Star A is a “spectroscopic binary,” which means its companion is detected by looking at a spectra of Star A.

    b.  This companion is so close to Star A, they orbit each other in just under 7 days.  This means they’re closer than Mercury is to our Sun.

2.  The dimmer star, Star B, may also be part of a multiple system.

3.  Through the telescope, dim stars can be seen close to both Stars A and B.  It is unclear whether these stars form multiple systems with A and B, or if they are also optical doubles.

1.	This is actually a 5-member system.  A third star has a magnitude of 9.5 and a period of about 1,000 years.
