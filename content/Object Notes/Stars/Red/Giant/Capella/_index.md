### In the telescope

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope a bright yellowish point of light should be seen.

### Capella Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  Capella is 4th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (6th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2.  The name “Capella” derives from the Latin for “She-goat”, referring to goats carried by Auriga (the name of the constellation).
 
3.  While only one star is seen through the telescope, Capella is actually a multiple star system, with at least 4 components.  (They cannot be seen because Capella is far away from us, and the components are quite close to each other.)

    a.  Stars Capella A and Capella B are a spectroscopic multiple.

      * Both A and B are giant stars, a bit past the hydrogen-fusing, main-sequence phase of their lives.

      * Capella A is spectral type G8-K0 III, is about 3 times the mass of the sun, about 12 times its diameter, and about 80 times brighter.

      * B is spectral type G1 III, slightly less massive, smaller, and not as bright as Capella A.

      * A and B are only about 68 million miles away from each other (0.73 AU), about the same distance from our Sun to the planet Venus.

      * They only take 104 days to orbit each other.  Venus and our sun take 225 days.

    b.	Stars Capella C and Capella D are about 11,000 AU’s (0.17 light years) from A and B.

      * Both C and D are “red dwarfs”, cool stars that are still in the hydrogen-fusing, main-sequence phase of their lives.

      * Capella C is spectral type M1V, is only 30-40% the mass of our sun, half its diameter, and about as bright.

      * Capella D is spectral type M4-5 V, only a tenth of our sun’s mass, only 23-30% its diameter, and only 0.05% as bright.

      * C and D are about 4 1/2 billion miles away from each other (48 AU),  further than Pluto is from our Sun.

      * C and D take about 390 years to orbit each other.
