### In the telescope

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope a bright reddish-orange point of light should be seen.

### Betelgeuse Information

---
<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.  Betelgeuse is the 7th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (9th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
2.  An irregularly pulsating red supergiant – its diameter may vary as much as 60% during the whole cycle.

3.  Note the size of this star: if Betelgeuse were placed in our solar system at our sun’s position, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and maybe even Jupiter would be inside Betelgeuse!

4.  This is the biggest star seen from Earth, and probably one of the biggest anywhere.
   
5.  In December 2019, Betelgeuse experienced the "Great Dimming" when it "coughed" out a huge chunk of material, ejected from the surface of the star, having the mass several times that of the Earth's Moon.  This material cooled and obscured the light of the star as viewed from Earth causing the "Great Dimming".

|Coordinates|2003-01-06|tweaked a bit|
|Magnitude|2003-01-06|previously 0.70 – BUT SIMBAD says 0.58, and Flamsteed says 0.45|
|Distance|2003-01-06|previously 520 – BUT now OK with Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection and SIMBAD|
|Actual Brightness|2003-01-06|previously 14,000 – BUT now OK with Flamsteed|
|Surface Temperature|2003-01-06|can’t find direct support, but OK with numbers given in Flamsteed|
|Diameter|2003-01-06|previously:480-800 million miles / 550-920 times sun – BUT think it’s safe to say over 800 million - beyond Jupiter’s orbit - like said in <http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970216.html>|
|Mass|2003-01-06|can find no support, but sounds good|
|Surface Gravity| -- |   |
|Surface Composition| 2003-01-06|OK for all stars|
|Spectral Type|2003-01-06|OK with Scott’s Flamsteed|
|Density|2003-01-06|previously: <10-6  – BUT can find no support for this|
