### In the telescope

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.  When people look through the telescope they should see a faint star.  It may appear to be a pale yellow.

### Beta Comae Berenices Information

1.  This is the second brightest star in the constellation Coma Berenices, Berenice’s Hair.

2.  The Greek Konon of Samos (born 247 B.C.) named this constellation after Egyptian Queen Berenice.

3.  The story: beautiful Berenice cut her long, beautiful hair as a sacrifice to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, hoping for her husband’s safe return from war.  King Ptolemy III of Egypt did indeed return safely.  Zeus and Aphrodite were so touched by Berenice’s sacrifice that they placed her hair in the heavens.

4.  Berenice died in 221 B.C.  Apparently, she was determined, scheming, and politically ambitious.

5.  The north pole of our Milky Way galaxy is located in Coma Berenices.

6.  The weak Coma Berenicid meteor shower occurs from early December to late January (about December 8 to January 23).

7.  This star is like our sun in several ways.  It is about the same size, about the same temperature, and it is also fusing hydrogen in its core.  It also has similar magnetic activity, meaning beta Coma Berenices probably has sunspots, flares, prominences, etc.

8.  This star is not like our sun in several ways.  So far, no planets have been found orbiting the star.  (There’s not even a dust disk around the star, the leftovers of planetary formation.)  It has a bit more iron than our sun.  Also, its rotation period is half that of our sun’s, so beta Coma Berenices’ solar cycle is about 16.6 years, as compared to our sun’s 11 year cycle.
