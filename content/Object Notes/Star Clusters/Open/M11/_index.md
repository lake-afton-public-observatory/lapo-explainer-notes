1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80mm.

1.	Through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars.

### M11 Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	This cluster is also called the Wild Duck Cluster, apparently because it resembles a flight of wild ducks when viewed through a telescope. It is also known as the _**Salt and Pepper Cluster**_ and NGC 6705. It’s common name comes from Admiral Smyth, who noted in the 1800s that its fan-shaped appearance resembles a “flight of wild ducks”.
   
1.	Most of the brightest main sequence stars are of spectral type A and F.
   
1.	It also has about 500 stars which are brighter than 14th magnitude.
   
1.	Open clusters likely formed from the same cloud of gas & dust

1.  The average separation of the stars in the cluster is about 1 light year.
   
1.	All of the bright stars in this cluster are very luminous giants.
    
1.	The total brightness of the cluster is about 10,000 times the brightness of the sun.

1.	M11 was first discovered by Gottfried Kirch of the Berlin Observatory in 1681, and apparently was first resolved into stars by William Derham in 1733. Charles Messier included it into his catalog in 1764.

1.  This cluster is visible in binoculars or a small telescope.
