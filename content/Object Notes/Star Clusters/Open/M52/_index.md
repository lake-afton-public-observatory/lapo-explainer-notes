### In the telescope

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

1.	When people look through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars; much like sugar or salt sprinkled on a table top.

### M52 Information

<span style='float:right;'>[top](#)</span>

1.	This cluster was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774.

1.	The estimated distance to M52 varies: much of the light from M52 has been absorbed by gas and dust between us and the cluster.  It is difficult to determine just how much light has been absorbed, so it is difficult to estimate the distance to the cluster.  A distance of about 5,000 light years is the best estimate so far.

1.	Average separation of stars in this cluster is about 1 light year.
