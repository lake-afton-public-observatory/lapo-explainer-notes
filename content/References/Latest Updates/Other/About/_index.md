The content for these Explainer Notes are managed under the  
GitHub - LAPO Explainer Notes website [repo](https://github.com/lake-afton-public-observatory/lapo-explainer-notes).

If you have any suggestions for content, product questions,  
or are not finding the detail necessary for supporting these LAPO Explainer Notes,  
please email your comments to [LAPO Tech Support](mailto://cketron@lakeafton.com>)

In an effort to make Observatory Explainer notes more accessible, the notes left behind by WSU staff have been translated into Markdown (*.md) files and using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework for building a static website. The MarkDown content files are converted into HTML web-based documentation. Additional notes have been contributed by KAO and volunteer staff at the observatory. The LAPO Explainer Notes use the [Hugo - TechDocs](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-techdoc/) theme.

The pages are themed to support nightvision (red text on black) so that they can be served up directly in the observing room at LAPO ... see ..\static\css\nightvision.css

Content suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated!! (Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/lake-afton-public-observatory/lapo-explainer-notes/issues) on the GitHub project.)
